# Animated "Boo" Webpage 👻

A small interactive animation created while practicing web design and animation concepts.  
When you touch or hover, the “Boo” bubble moves — just a fun way to explore basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript animation logic.

### 💡 Purpose
This project was made for learning and exploration purposes only.  
The base idea and inspiration were taken from an online source, and I recreated it to understand how animations work in web development.
